## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center of the table.  
2. Sort ingredient tiles by type and place in the **Pantry** (off-board area).  
3. Separate recipe strips by length (2, 3, 4, 5), shuffle each pile, and place face-down near the board.  
4. Place Action Cards face-up in the **Kitchen**:
   - 2 players: 1 of each type (5 total).
   - 3 players: 2 Wasabi!, 2 Spicy!, 1 Chop!, 1 Switch!, 1 Stack! (7 total).
   - 4 players: All 10 cards.  
5. Place all Wasabi Cubes in a shared supply near the board.  
6. Give each player:
   - 1 Screen
   - 1 Bowl
   - 10 Challenge Tokens (same color)
   Set Challenge Tokens in front of each player, length-side up, visible to all.  
7. Starting player (chosen arbitrarily) begins the setup for hands and recipes.

#### Starting Hand Rules:
- Each player receives 3 ingredient tiles.

- **Rice**, **Maki**, and **unique ingredients** are **not allowed** in starting hands.
- Players may hide their ingredients behind their Screen.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of two steps:

#### Step 1: Play Ingredient and (Optional) Action Card  
- **Must** play exactly **one ingredient tile** onto an unoccupied square within the active board area.
- **May** play **one Action Card** (before or after placing the tile, depending on card).
- **Alternative: Pass**
  - Skip Step 1 entirely.
  - Discard **some or all** of your current recipes.
  - Discarded recipes go to the **bottom** of their respective stacks.
  - Proceed to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Prepare for Next Turn  
In order:
1. **Collect Action Cards** (1 per recipe completed this turn):
   - Choose from available cards in the Kitchen **or** Wasabi! cards currently on the board.
   - Cannot choose the **same type** of card you played this turn, unless no other option exists.
   - Maximum of **2 Action Cards** in hand at any time.
   - May discard extra cards to the Kitchen at any time.
   - Cards may be concealed behind Screen.
2. **Refill Ingredients**:
   - If you have fewer than 3 ingredient tiles, draw from the Pantry until you have 3.
3. **Refill Recipes**:
   - If you have fewer than 3 recipes in your Screen, draw new ones (any length) until you have 3.
   - May look at each drawn recipe before drawing the next.

Turn ends. Play passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Completing a Recipe  
- A recipe is completed when you form a straight **horizontal or vertical line** of ingredients that **matches one of your recipes** in **content** (not necessarily order).
- You must place the **final tile** that completes the sequence.
- Sequence may include tiles placed earlier by any player.
- Adjacent tiles (not in line) do not affect validity.

##### Conditions to Complete:
- You must have an **unassigned Challenge Token** of the same length as the recipe.
- If not, you **cannot complete** the recipe, even if sequence matches.

##### Completing with Style:
- If ingredient order **exactly matches** the recipe strip, you complete it **with style**.
- For recipes longer than 2 parts, you earn **Wasabi Cubes** as indicated on the Challenge Token’s length-side.
- Example: A 3-part recipe completed with style earns 1 Wasabi Cube (if shown on token).

##### Multiple Recipes:
- You may complete **more than one recipe** in a single turn through:
  - Strategic tile placement.
  - Use of Action Cards (e.g., Switch!, Chop!).

#### After Completion:
- Remove the recipe strip from your Screen and place it face-up in front of you.
- Place a Challenge Token (correct length, point-side up) on it.
- If completed with style, take Wasabi Cubes and place in your Bowl.
- Once assigned, a recipe **cannot be lost**, even if board changes.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **either** of the following occurs:

#### A) Instant Win:
- A player assigns their **10th Challenge Token** to a completed recipe.
- That player **immediately wins**, regardless of score.

#### B) Board Full:
- At the **end of a player’s turn**, if **all board squares** are filled (by ingredient tiles or Wasabi! cards), the game ends.
- All players tally:
  - Points from **assigned Challenge Tokens** (point-side values).
  - **1 point per Wasabi Cube** in their Bowl.
- Highest total wins.

#### Tiebreaker:
1. Most Wasabi Cubes.
2. If still tied, game ends in a **draw**.

> **Note**: If placing a tile completes a recipe and you choose to remove a Wasabi! card during Step 2, the board may no longer be full—game continues.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

#### Q: Can I complete a recipe that spans across a stack?  
A: No. Only the **top tile** of a stack is considered in play. Stacks count as a single tile.

#### Q: Can I play a Wasabi! card over already placed Wasabi! cards?  
A: No. Wasabi! cards **cannot overlap**, even partially.

#### Q: Can I complete a recipe if one of its tiles is under a Wasabi! card?  
A: No. Covered tiles are **locked** and cannot be used in recipes.

#### Q: Can I play an Action Card after passing?  
A: No. Passing skips Step 1 entirely—no ingredient played, no Action Card played.

#### Q: Can I discard an Action Card at any time?  
A: Yes. You may return any or all Action Cards to the Kitchen at any time, even during another player’s turn, to stay within the 2-card hand limit.

#### Q: Can I complete a recipe using a tile from a stack via Chop!?  
A: Yes. If you use Chop! to remove the top tile of a stack, revealing a tile that completes a sequence, and you are the one placing it (via option B), you may complete the recipe.

#### Q: Do Wasabi! card-covered squares count as filled for endgame?  
A: Yes. Covered squares count as **occupied** for determining when the board is full.

#### Q: Can any player remove a Wasabi! card from the board?  
A: Yes. Any player who completes a recipe may choose a Wasabi! card on the board as their reward during Step 2.
