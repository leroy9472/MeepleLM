## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Over 1000 years ago, tea from Yunnan was transported via the Tea-Horse Road to Tibet and India. In this game, players lead trading teams to sell tea across provinces, investing in progress early and converting income into victory points (VP) later. The goal is to build the most advanced and profitable trading empire.

The game ends when a player reaches **80 VP** or **all 14 Presents are distributed**. After final scoring, the player with the most VP wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game board showing provinces, progress buildings, and tracks  
- 5 sets of player components (per color):  
  - 7 Traders (meeple)

  - 2 Progress markers (octagonal)  
  - 1 Turn Order marker (octagonal)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:

#### Phase 1: Auction Phase  
**1A) Place Traders**  
- In **green Auction track** order, players take turns to:  
  - **Place a Trader** from personal supply or any province (not Pu'er or buildings) into:  
    - A **Progress Building** (one trader per building)  
    - The **Bank** (left or right space)  
    - **Pu'er** (Market)  
  - Or **Pass**:  
    - Move Turn Order marker to black strip between tracks  
    - All remaining traders in hand go to Pu'er  
    - Exit auction unless outbid on 5/7 (see below)  

**Progress Building Rules**:  
- Cannot place in a building if already have a trader there  
- Can only bid on **5 or 7** space if currently highest bidder  
- If outbid on 5/7, trader returns to personal supply  
- If a passed player is outbid on 5/7, they “un-pass” — move marker back to auction track and continue  
- Cannot bid more than current money (basic game); Pro game allows debt via VP loss  
- Cannot bid if maxed out in that progress track  

**Bank Placement**:  
- Immediately move all own traders from progress buildings to Pu'er  
- May only place in Bank or Pu'er for remainder of auction  
- Cannot use both Bank spaces in one auction  

**1B) Resolve Bank**  
- If any trader in Bank:  
  - Sum all bids from all progress buildings (max 99)  
  - Find total on score track → identify dark/light band → use corresponding gold circle (e.g., 27/15)  
  - Left Bank space: receives higher amount  
  - Right Bank space: receives lower amount  
  - Pay from general supply; return traders to personal supply  

**1C) Resolve Progress Buildings**  
- In **green Auction track** order:  
  - Pay all bids  
  - Take benefits and return trader to personal supply  
  - **Trading School**: Take 1 trader from general supply → place in Pu'er  
  - **Customs Office**: Advance Border Pass marker +1 (increases movement allowance)  
  - **Horse Trader**: Move Horse one province forward on main road (unlocks access)  
  - **Dragon House**: Advance Influence marker +1 (Dragon head)  
  - **Construction Yard**: Take one of:  
    - Bridge  
    - Trading Post  
    - Tea House  
    - → Place in personal supply  
    - **Optional**: Immediately build Tea House in accessible province (if space empty)  

#### Phase 2: Travel Phase  
**2A) Travel, Displace, Build**  
- Move all Turn Order markers from black strip to **brown Travel track** (reverses order)  
- In brown track order:  
  - **Move** traders from provinces or Pu'er (not personal supply)  
    - May move any number of traders  
    - Movement:  
      - Cross borders along main road or own bridges  
      - Max total borders crossed = value on Border Pass track  
      - Distribute freely among traders  
      - Cannot end in starting province  
      - Cannot move beyond Horse’s current province  
  - **Displace**:  
    - After ending movement in a province, may displace **one** opponent’s trader if:  
      - Your Influence > opponent’s  
      - Displaced trader moves one step **toward Pu'er** along main road (not via bridge)  
      - Displaced trader cannot displace others  
  - **Build**:  
    - Build any number of structures from personal supply:  
      - **Trading Post**: Any accessible province; multiple allowed per province  
      - **Bridge**: Only at marked ravines; must have access to both sides  
      - **Tea House**: Only one per province (any player); must have access  
  - **Connected Route Check (end of turn)**:  
    - All traders **without** a connected route to Pu'er (via own traders/trading posts/bridges) return to Pu'er  
    - Trading posts stay regardless  

**2B) Province Inspector**  
- Move Inspector to province (≠ Pu'er) with **highest tea income** (sum of all traders + connected trading posts; ignore transport costs)  
  - Tie? Farther from Pu'er wins  
- Banish **one** trader from that province:  
  - Eligible: Traders whose player has **<4 Influence** and **no Tea House** in province  
  - Among eligible, banish trader of player with **highest Influence**  
    - Tie? Use brown Travel track order (earlier = banished)  
  - If no eligible traders → no banishment  
- Return Inspector to start  

**2C) Presents**  
- For each province with remaining presents:  
  - Distribute one present per trader, in order of:  
    1. **Influence (descending)**  
    2. **Brown Travel track order** (if tied)  
  - If more traders than presents:  
    - Distribute one at a time, cycling through players by influence and then travel order  
    - Repeat until all presents gone  

**2D) Determine Income**  
- In **brown Travel track** order:  
  - Calculate income:  
    - Each trader/trading post earns province value  
    - **Trading post must be connected** to earn  
    - For each **gap** (missing presence) on best route from Pu'er to a trader:  
      - Subtract **3 Yuan per gap per trader**  
    - Gaps do not affect trading post income (they just earn nothing if disconnected)  
  - Place Income marker on corresponding space on score track  
    - Stack if same income (later players on top)  

**2E) New Turn Order**  
- Reorder Turn Order markers on **brown Travel track** by income:  
  - Highest income first  
  - Tie? Marker on top (later in previous order) goes first  

**2F) Convert Income to VP**  
- In new brown track order:  
  - Convert any portion of income into VP at **1:1**  
  - Take remaining as money  
  - Move VP marker; remove Income marker  

**2G) End of Round**  
- Move all traders from **Pu'er** to personal supply  
- Move all Turn Order markers back to **green Auction track** (reverses order again)  
- (Pro game) Advance Round marker by 1  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order Reversal**: Alternates between Auction (green) and Travel (brown) phases  
- **Connected Route**: Path from Pu'er through provinces with own traders/trading posts/bridges. Required for trader income and survival at end of turn.  
- **Bidding**: Must pay all bids during 1C. Cannot overbid in basic game.  
- **Influence**: Affects displacement and Inspector immunity (4+ or Tea House = safe)  
- **Horse**: Limits access to provinces; must advance via Horse Trader building  
- **Movement**: Total border crossings capped by Border Pass track  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- Any player reaches **80+ VP**  
- **OR** all 14 Presents are distributed  
→ Complete current round through 2F; skip 2G  

**Final Scoring**:  
- **Money**: 1 VP per 3 Yuan (round down)  
- **Presents**: 3 VP each  
- **Tea Houses**: 12 VP each  
- **Border Pass Track**:  
  - Level 0: 0 VP  
  - Level 1: 1 VP  
  - Level 2: 4 VP  
  - Level 3: 9 VP  
  - Level 4: 16 VP  
- **Influence Track**: Same scale (0/1/4/9/16 VP)  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Higher Influence (Dragon House level)  
2. Earlier position on **brown Travel track**  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a bridge to form a connected route?**  
  Yes — your own bridges may be used in route tracing.  

- **What if my route is broken by another player’s move?**  
  Traders stay in place but incur **transport costs** (3 Yuan per gap). Not returned to Pu'er.  

- **Can I build a Tea House immediately after taking it?**  
  Only if taken from **Construction Yard** this round — and only if you have access and space is free.  

- **Does Tea House count toward connected route?**  
  No — only traders and trading posts matter for connectivity.  

- **Can I displace after moving through multiple provinces?**  
  Yes — as long as movement ends in a province with opponents and your Influence is higher.  

- **Can I place a trader from a province into a progress building?**  
  Yes — from round 2 onward, traders may be retracted from provinces (not Pu'er or buildings) for bidding.  

- **Pro Game Debt**:  
  - If short on money, lose VP = (9 – current round) × Yuan short  
  - VP can go negative (use "-100" side)
