### 4. Gameplay Flow
**Phase 1: Muscle (Bidding & Driver Graft)**
1. Reveal top Truck card (if none already showing)
2. Place Men of Action cards in offer spaces (1 per player)
3. Players simultaneously select Muscle cards
4. Reveal cards; order play by highest to lowest
5. In order:
   - Pay Driver Graft ($1G per Small/Medium Truck, $2G per Large Truck) and Muscle card cost
   - Choose one available card (Truck or Men of Action)
6. Discard unchosen Men of Action cards; leave unchosen Truck card

**Phase 2: Send in the Boys (Influence Placement)**
- In Muscle order, players place Influence markers from Back Room to Speakeasies
- Speakeasies open when Influence ≥ shaded circles
- Controlling Influence: ≥ sum of all others
- Majority Influence: > any single opponent but < sum of others
- Minority Influence: ≥1 marker but not controlling/majority
- No Influence: line up at Public Dock

**Phase 3: Fire up the Still (Production)**
1. Roll production dice at all Stills
2. Place crates in Back Room
3. If Copper at Family Still and roll includes 5: no production
4. Move Copper to player with highest Family Still production (ties: lowest Muscle wins)

**Phase 4: Run the Whiskey (Shipping)**
1. Negotiate: sell crates, rent/buy trucks
2. Load crates onto trucks
3. Move trucks to Speakeasies in Muscle order:
   - Controlling/Majority: Majority Dock (★★★)
   - Minority: Minority Dock (★★)
   - No Influence: Public Dock (★)

**Phase 5: "What's the Password?" (Selling)**
1. For each open Speakeasy (smallest to largest):
   - Roll consumption dice (add +1 per Speakeasy Improvement)
   - Sell in order: Majority Dock → Minority Dock → Public Dock (if permitted)
   - Pay wholesale price ($1-3G/crate) from bank
   - Controlling Influence player collects profit margin ($1-2G/crate) on all sales
2. Return rented trucks and crates to supply

**Phase 6: The Heat!**
1. After Rounds 4 and 8:
   - All players gain 1 Influence marker
   - Lowest money player gains +1 (tie: lowest Muscle)
2. Discard played Muscle cards
3. Advance round marker

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Influence Hierarchy**: Controlling > Majority > Minority > No Influence
- **Priority**: Determined by Muscle card value throughout game
- **Dealmaking**: Open negotiation allowed for crates, trucks, cards, promises (non-binding)
- **Thug Cards**: Playable when Muscle cards are revealed; timing priority to higher Muscle
- **Copper**: Shuts down Family Still production on roll of 5; moves to highest producer
- **Remote Stills**: Immune to Copper; vulnerable to sabotage

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after Phase 5 of:
  - Round 12, OR
  - First round where any player reaches $100G
- Winner: Player with most money
- Tiebreaker: Highest Muscle card played in final round

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Unpaid Graft**: Pay all you can; no penalty
- **Influence Changes After Placement**: Trucks don't move; unloading order unchanged; payouts follow new influence
- **Big Payoff**: Grants temporary Controlling Influence; trucks don't reposition
- **Hijack**: Requires empty truck; stolen crates become your property
- **Hey, Free Truck**: Can steal empty trucks after hijack/bust
- **Moll**: Target pays what they can if insufficient funds
- **Warehouse**: Save unshipped crates only
- **Friendly Union Boss**: Lasts until canceled by Investigation
- **Destroyed Influence**: Returns to supply, not Back Room
- **O'Malley's**: Always open; unlimited consumption; no profit margin; can be closed by G-Men
