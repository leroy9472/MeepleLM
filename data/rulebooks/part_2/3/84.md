### 1. Lore & Objective
Rommel in the Desert is a two-player strategy game based on the North African Campaign of World War II. One player commands the Allied (British and Commonwealth) forces, and the other commands the Axis (German and Italian) forces.

The primary objective is to capture Tobruk and its environs, or to maintain a superior army if Tobruk remains contested. Capturing the enemy Base (El Agheila for Axis, Alexandria for Allies) results in an immediate Strategic Victory.

### 2. Components
- Hexagonal mapboard depicting Libya and Egypt
- Wooden block units (black for Axis, red for Allies)
- Die-cut adhesive labels (dark green for German, light green for Italian, tan for Allied units)
- Supply Cards (real and dummy)
- Game Record Sheets
- Turn marker

### 3. Setup
- **Map Orientation**: Axis player sits on the south edge, Allied player on the north edge.
- **Units**: Label wooden blocks with appropriate unit labels. Units stand upright with labels facing the owning player.
- **Deployment**: Players deploy starting forces according to the chosen scenario. Axis deploys first.
- **Supply Cards**: Deal initial supply cards as specified by the scenario. Players may discard and redraw their initial hand once (Axis first, then Allies).
